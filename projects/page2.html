        <h2>Naruto</h2>
            <img src="images/naruto.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.</p>
                <p>Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes</p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
                <p>Naruto was the first anime that I watched while <em>knowing</em> it was Japanese animation. I had watched other shows like Digimon or Yu-Gi-oh, but just thought of as cartoons. Although a bit odd, I came to really enjoy watching Naruto grow up. His struggles reflected a lot of what was going on in my life. As a teenager who was trying to understand what the hell was going on around me, Naruto helped pushed me along. Thus, it will always be my top fav anime.</p>

        <h2>Tokyo Ghoul</h2>
            <img src="images/tokyoghoul.jpeg" width="500" alt="">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.</p>
                <p>Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies</p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
                <p>I really enjoy horror films or stories, so the dark world within Tokyo Ghoul was an instant addiction. The struggle the main charater faces, Ken Kaneki, really reflects the struggles that some of us really face on a daily basis: how do we fit within our own world? Besides the story, the character development really takes you into an emotional ride.Highly recommend reading the manga over watching the anime.</p>
