            <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.</p>
                <p>Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes</p>
            <h3>Reason</h3>
                <p>Naruto was the first anime that I watched while <em>knowing</em> it was Japanese animation. I had watched other shows like Digimon or Yu-Gi-oh, but just thought of as cartoons. Although a bit odd, I came to really enjoy watching Naruto grow up. His struggles reflected a lot of what was going on in my life. As a teenager who was trying to understand what the hell was going on around me, Naruto helped pushed me along. Thus, it will always be my top fav anime.</p>
