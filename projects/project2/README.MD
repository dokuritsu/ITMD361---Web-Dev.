Main Project - Utilized CSS to Style Previous Project
------------------------------------------
This project will consist of three stages. The first stage consists of styling the three previous HTML pages with no Javascript present. Out of those three pages, one will act as a resume, while the other two can be any topic. In this case, my other two pages will probably be about my favorite Japanese animation.

The next stage will consist of adding Javascript.
