            <h2>Drawing Anime</h2>
                <p>I used to love drawing and writing stories. So one day I decided to adventure into drawing anime. I could sketch basic stuff, but never had the courage to color them. Here are a few images. Ignore the rotated Naruto.</p>
                <div class="gallery">
                    <a target="_blank" href="images/dNaruto.jpg">
                        <img src="images/dNaruto.jpg" alt="Naruto Drawing" width="600" height="400">
                    </a>
                    <div class="galleryDesc">I recall watching a fanmade video where Naruto and all where in highschool. This was the result of watching that.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="gallery">
                    <a target="_blank" href="images/dAngelBeats.jpg">
                        <img src="images/dAngelBeats.jpg" alt="Angel Beats Drawing" width="600" height="400">
                    </a>
                    <div class="galleryDesc">This is mainly from the opening of Angel Beats. The characters shown here are Otonashi and Yuri.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="gallery">
                    <a target="_blank" href="images/dInuyasha.jpg">
                        <img src="images/dInuyasha.jpg" alt="Inuyasha Drawing" width="350" height="270">
                    </a>
                    <div class="galleryDesc">I believe this was from the first ending of Inuyasha. Inuyasha is normally very grumpy or angry. This scene captures a side of him that he hardly shows.</div>
                </div>

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>I've always enjoyed playing videos games ever since I was required to use a computer for school work. The games I play vary from competitive shooting games like Rainbow Six Siege to adventure type games like Subnautica. Here are a few others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
                    <li>League of Legends</li>
                    <li>Tomb Raider Series</li>
                    <li>Monster Hunter World</li>
                    <li>Stardew Valley</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Let's Go</li>
                    <li>Subnautica</li>
                    <li>Etc...</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Pokemon Go</h2>
                <p>I have to admit, I was never a fan of pokemon. I was a digimon fan all the way, but catching and collecting pokemon has become really fun. I started two days after the game came out because a friend of mine was playing and so to spend more time with them, I decided to start it up. Now I'm really dedicated to catching them all. Add me for gifts, raiding, and trading:</p>
