            <h2>Reading Long Series</h2>
                <p>Besides watching anime and reading manga, I love reading long fiction novels. Here are some of the series I've finished of:</p>

                        <li>The Inhertiance Cycle by Christopher Paolini</li>

            <h2>Drawing Anime</h2>
                <p>I used to love drawing and writing stories. So one day I decided to adventure into drawing anime. I could sketch basic stuff, but never had the courage to color them. Here are a few images. Ignore the rotated Naruto.</p>

                <img src="images/dInuyasha.jpg" alt="">

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>I've always enjoyed playing videos games ever since I was required to use a computer for school work. The games I play vary from competitive shooting games like Rainbow Six Siege to adventure type games like Subnautica. Here are a few others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
                    <li>League of Legends</li>
                    <li>Tomb Raider Series</li>
                    <li>Monster Hunter World</li>
                    <li>Stardew Valley</li>
                    <li>Pokemon Let's Go</li>
                    <li>Subnautica</li>
                    <li>Etc...</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Pokemon Go</h2>
                <p>I have to admit, I was never a fan of pokemon. I was a digimon fan all the way, but catching and collecting pokemon has become really fun. I started two days after the game came out because a friend of mine was playing and so to spend more time with them, I decided to start it up. Now I'm really dedicated to catching them all. Add me for gifts, raiding, and trading:</p>
