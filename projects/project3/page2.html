                                <h1>Naruto</h1>
                                <p>Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.</p>
                                <p>Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes</p>
                                <h2>Reason</h2>
                                <p>Naruto was the first anime that I watched while <em>knowing</em> it was Japanese animation. I had watched other shows like Digimon or Yu-Gi-oh, but just thought of as cartoons. Although a bit odd, I came to really enjoy watching Naruto grow up. His struggles reflected a lot of what was going on in my life. As a teenager who was trying to understand what the hell was going on around me, Naruto helped pushed me along. Thus, it will always be my top fav anime.</p>

                                <h1>Tokyo Ghoul</h1>
                                <p>Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans. The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans and blend in with society.</p>
                                <p>Based on the best-selling supernatural horror manga by Sui Ishida, Tokyo Ghoul follows Ken Kaneki, a shy, bookish college student, who is instantly drawn to Rize Kamishiro, an avid reader like himself. However, Rize is not exactly who she seems, and this unfortunate meeting pushes Kaneki into the dark depths of the ghouls' inhuman world. In a twist of fate, Kaneki is saved by the enigmatic waitress Touka Kirishima, and thus begins his new, secret life as a half-ghoul/half-human who must find a way to integrate into both societies</p>
                                <h2>Reason</h2>
                                <p>I really enjoy horror films or stories, so the dark world within Tokyo Ghoul was an instant addiction. The struggle the main charater faces, Ken Kaneki, really reflects the struggles that some of us really face on a daily basis: how do we fit within our own world? Besides the story, the character development really takes you into an emotional ride.Highly recommend reading the manga over watching the anime.</p>

                                <h1>Haikyuu</h1>
                                <p>Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action, small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament; however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," Tobio Kageyama. Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate.</p>
                                <p>Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power. Surprisingly, Kageyama has his own problems that only Hinata can help with, and learning to work together appears to be the only way for the team to be successful. Based on Haruichi Furudate's popular shounen manga of the same name, Haikyuu!! is an exhilarating and emotional sports comedy following two determined athletes as they attempt to patch a heated rivalry in order to make their high school volleyball team the best in Japan.</p>
                                <h2>Reason</h2>
                                <p>I love sports when I was in elementary and middle school, but once I hit high school, it wasn't something that I could dedicate myself to unlike others. This anime makes you want to go out and play a sport again. Specfically, volleyball. The vibe is motivating and inspiring. It's a must watch.</p>

                                <h1>Hunter x Hunter</h1>
                                <p>Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories. Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon realizes the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever imagined.</p>
                                <p>Along the way to becoming an official Hunter, Gon befriends the lively doctor-in-training Leorio, vengeful Kurapika, and rebellious ex-assassin Killua. To attain their own goals and desires, together the four of them take the Hunter Exam, notorious for its low success rate and high probability of death. Throughout their journey, Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts them through many hardships and struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and characters—all while learning what being a Hunter truly means.</p>
                                <h2>Reason</h2>
                                <p>This reminded me a lot about Naruto when I was watching it. The character development is really the highlight of this anime. Gon has a very child-like innocence at the beginnning of the anime while Killua is more cold-hearted and reserved, but once btoh experience true pain and suffering, you can see that them do a complete 180 in their goals. The anime really goes into the friendship of these two, which made this a very fun and interesting watch.</p>

                               <h1>My Hero Academia</h1>
                                <p>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual</p>
                                <p>Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!</p>
                                <p>Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.</p>
                                <h2>Reason</h2>
                                <p>Another shounen type anime that really captured my attention. The animation and the fights are damn insane and the characters are just super loveable.</p>
