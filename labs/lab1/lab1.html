  <h1>Lab 1 - Self-Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello world. This is not my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Laura and I'm majoring in Computer Science. This is my final year at IIT and want to know more about web development, thus I am here.</p>
  <p>I love anime, so I'll probably be one of those people that showcases their favorite anime and hope to make you curious enough to watch.</p>
  <p>I also enjoy playing video games on my sparetime (No, not Fortnite). Mostly enjoy singleplayer games but do have a few multiplayer games.</p>
  <p>That's pretty much it for a self-introduction.</p>
